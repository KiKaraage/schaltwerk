# CLAUDE.md - Schaltwerk Development Guidelines

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the Schaltwerk codebase.

## Project Overview

Schaltwerk is a Tauri-based desktop application that provides a visual interface for managing Schaltwerk sessions. It features multiple terminal panels, session management, and real-time status monitoring.

## Essential Development Commands

### Before Completing ANY Task

**IMPORTANT**: Always run these commands before considering a task complete:

```bash
# Run all tests and lints
npm run test

# Or individually:
npm run lint          # TypeScript type checking
npm run lint:rust     # Rust clippy linting
npm run build:rust    # Rust compilation check
```

### Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev           # Start Vite dev server
npm run build         # Build TypeScript/React frontend
npm run tauri dev     # Run full Tauri app in development mode
npm run check         # Full check (alias for npm run test)
```

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
```
src/
├── components/       # React components
│   ├── Terminal.tsx  # Core terminal renderer using xterm.js
│   ├── TerminalGrid.tsx  # Main dual-terminal layout
│   ├── LazyGitPanel.tsx  # Right panel terminal
│   └── Sidebar.tsx   # Session list and navigation
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
│   ├── useSessionTerminals.ts     # Single terminal management
│   └── useSessionTerminalPair.ts  # Dual terminal management
└── App.tsx          # Main application component
```

### Backend (Rust/Tauri)
```
src-tauri/
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs      # Tauri app entry point and commands
│   ├── pty.rs       # Terminal PTY management
│   └── cleanup.rs   # Process cleanup on exit
└── Cargo.toml       # Rust dependencies
```

## Key Features

### Terminal Management
- **Session-aware terminals**: Each session has 3 terminals (top, bottom, right)
- **Lazy creation**: Terminals created only when first needed
- **Persistent state**: Terminals keep running when switching sessions
- **Proper cleanup**: All processes killed when app exits

### Terminal ID Convention
```
Orchestrator:
- orchestrator-top
- orchestrator-bottom  
- orchestrator-right

Sessions:
- session-{name}-top
- session-{name}-bottom
- session-{name}-right
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**MANDATORY**: Follow red-green-refactor cycle for all new code:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test first that defines the expected behavior
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

**TDD Rules**:
- Never write production code without a failing test
- Write only enough test code to make it fail
- Write only enough production code to make the test pass
- All tests must remain green after each implementation step
- No workarounds or skipped tests - fix issues immediately

**Benefits**:
- Ensures complete test coverage through red-green cycle
- Provides immediate feedback on implementation correctness
- Prevents untested code from entering the codebase
- Creates a safety net for future refactoring

### Before ANY Commit

**MANDATORY**: Run `npm run test` and ensure it passes completely. This command runs:
1. **TypeScript linting**: `npm run lint` - TypeScript must compile with no errors
2. **Rust linting**: `npm run lint:rust` - Clippy must pass with no warnings  
3. **Rust tests**: `npm run test:rust` - All unit tests must pass
4. **Rust build**: `npm run build:rust` - Must compile successfully

Never consider a task complete unless `npm run test` passes without errors.

**CRITICAL**: Test failures are NEVER unrelated. All tests must be green before:
- Committing any changes
- Merging any branches
- Considering any task complete

If tests are failing, they must be fixed immediately. Do not assume test failures are from previous changes or unrelated work. Every test failure indicates a real problem that must be resolved.

### Performance Test Failures

**CRITICAL**: Performance tests are indicators of actual performance issues and must be treated seriously:
- **Fix the performance issue**: When performance tests fail, investigate and fix the underlying performance problem
- **Never ignore performance tests**: Do not skip or disable failing performance tests
- **Exception for obsolete tests**: Only delete a performance test if it no longer makes sense (e.g., testing removed functionality)
- **Performance regressions matter**: Slower performance affects user experience and must be addressed

### Common Issues to Check
- Unused imports (both TypeScript and Rust)
- Missing JSX configuration in tsconfig.json
- Unhandled async/await in Tauri commands
- Terminal cleanup on app exit
- Memory leaks from event listeners

## Code Style Requirements

### TypeScript/React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Proper TypeScript types (avoid `any`)
- Clean up event listeners in useEffect
- Handle errors gracefully

### Rust
- Use `Result<T, String>` for Tauri commands
- Proper async/await handling
- Clean up resources (PTY processes, file handles)
- No clippy warnings allowed
- Use `#[warn(unused_imports)]` directive

## Critical Implementation Details

### Terminal Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: PTY process spawned on first session access
2. **Switching**: Frontend switches terminal IDs, backend processes persist
3. **Cleanup**: All processes killed via cleanup module on app exit

### Event System

#### Architecture Pattern
The app uses **Tauri events** for backend-to-frontend communication. NEVER use DOM events (`window.addEventListener`) for inter-component communication - always emit events from the backend.

#### Key Tauri Events
- `schaltwerk:sessions-refreshed`: Backend emits with full session list when sessions change (create/delete/state change)
- `schaltwerk:session-removed`: Backend emits when a session is deleted
- `schaltwerk:selection`: Frontend selection changes
- `terminal-output-{id}`: Terminal output streaming from backend

#### Implementation Pattern
When session state changes in backend:
1. Backend command performs the operation
2. Backend emits `app.emit("schaltwerk:sessions-refreshed", sessions)`
3. Frontend components listen via `listen()` from `@tauri-apps/api/event`
4. Components refresh their state when event received

Example backend:
```rust
#[tauri::command]
async fn para_core_start_draft_session(app: tauri::AppHandle, name: String) -> Result<(), String> {
    // ... perform operation ...
    if let Ok(sessions) = manager.list_enriched_sessions() {
        app.emit("schaltwerk:sessions-refreshed", &sessions)?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Example frontend:
```typescript
import { listen } from '@tauri-apps/api/event'

useEffect(() => {
    const unlisten = await listen('schaltwerk:sessions-refreshed', (event) => {
        setSessions(event.payload)
    })
    return () => { unlisten() }
}, [])

### Known Issues
- Terminal resize events need debouncing to prevent flicker
- Initial terminal size must match container dimensions
- Visibility detection prevents inactive terminals from processing input

## Development Workflow

1. Make changes
2. Run `npm run lint` to check TypeScript
3. Run `npm run lint:rust` to check Rust code
4. Run `npm run test` for full validation
5. Test in dev mode: `npm run tauri dev`
6. Only commit when all checks pass

## Important Notes

- **Never skip the test step**: Running `npm run test` before commits prevents broken builds
- **Terminal cleanup is critical**: Always ensure PTY processes are properly terminated
- **Session persistence**: Terminals should survive session switches but not app restarts
- **Resource management**: Each session creates 3 OS processes - handle with care

## Common Tasks

### Adding a new terminal panel
1. Create new component using `Terminal` component
2. Use `useSessionTerminals` hook for session awareness
3. Follow naming convention: `{context}-{position}`
4. Ensure cleanup in backend

### Debugging terminal issues
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check Tauri console for Rust errors
3. Verify terminal IDs match expected format
4. Use `ps aux | grep -E "zsh|bash|fish"` to check for orphaned processes
5. Check application logs (see Logging section below)

### Performance optimization
1. Minimize resize events with debouncing
2. Use visibility detection to pause inactive terminals
3. Lazy-create terminals only when needed
4. Properly dispose xterm.js instances

## Logging

### Overview
The application uses the Rust `log` crate with `env_logger` for comprehensive logging. Logs are written to both stderr (console) and a timestamped file for persistent debugging.

### Log File Location
Log files are automatically created at application startup:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/schaltwerk/logs/schaltwerk-{timestamp}.log`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/schaltwerk/logs/schaltwerk-{timestamp}.log`
- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\schaltwerk\logs\schaltwerk-{timestamp}.log`

The exact log file path is printed to stderr when the app starts with a 📝 emoji prefix.

### Log Levels
The application uses standard log levels with smart defaults:
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for our codebase (`ui`, `para_ui` modules)
- **INFO**: Important events and milestones (default for `portable_pty`, `tauri`)
- **WARN**: Potentially harmful situations (default for third-party crates)
- **ERROR**: Error events that might still allow the app to continue
- **TRACE**: Very detailed debugging (disabled by default)

### Configuring Log Levels
Set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to override defaults:
```bash
# Maximum verbosity for everything
RUST_LOG=trace npm run tauri dev

# Debug our code, warn for everything else
RUST_LOG=ui=debug,warn npm run tauri dev

# Only errors
RUST_LOG=error npm run tauri dev

# Debug specific module
RUST_LOG=ui::pty=trace npm run tauri dev
```

### Log Format
Logs use a consistent format for easy parsing:
```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm LEVEL module::path] Message
```

Example:
```
[2024-01-15 14:23:45.123 INFO  ui::pty] Creating terminal: id=orchestrator-top, cwd=/Users/name/project
[2024-01-15 14:23:45.456 DEBUG ui::pty] Saved child process for terminal orchestrator-top
[2024-01-15 14:23:45.789 WARN  ui::pty] Terminal orchestrator-bottom slow write: 25ms
```

### Logging in Rust Code
Use the appropriate macros from the `log` crate:

```rust
use log::{debug, info, warn, error};

// Informational messages for important events
info!("Terminal created successfully: id={id}");

// Debug messages for detailed flow tracking
debug!("Resizing terminal {id}: {cols}x{rows}");

// Warnings for recoverable issues
warn!("Terminal {id} slow write: {}ms", elapsed.as_millis());

// Errors for serious problems
error!("Failed to spawn terminal {id}: {e}");
```

### Best Practices
1. **Use structured logging**: Include relevant context (IDs, sizes, durations)
2. **Log at boundaries**: Entry/exit of major operations
3. **Performance metrics**: Log slow operations with timing
4. **Error context**: Always include error details and affected resources
5. **Avoid sensitive data**: Never log passwords, tokens, or user data

### Common Log Patterns

#### Terminal Lifecycle
```
INFO Creating terminal: id=session-main-top, cwd=/path
DEBUG Marked terminal session-main-top as being created
INFO Successfully spawned shell process for terminal session-main-top
DEBUG Saved child process for terminal session-main-top
INFO Terminal created successfully: id=session-main-top
```

#### Performance Issues
```
WARN Terminal orchestrator-bottom slow write: 25ms
DEBUG Terminal orchestrator-top slow buffer append: 15ms
```

#### Error Handling
```
ERROR Failed to spawn terminal session-test: Permission denied
WARN Failed to kill terminal process session-old: No such process
```

### Viewing Logs
```bash
# View latest log file (macOS)
tail -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/schaltwerk/logs/schaltwerk-*.log

# Filter for errors only
grep ERROR ~/Library/Application\ Support/schaltwerk/logs/schaltwerk-*.log

# Watch for specific terminal
grep "orchestrator-top" ~/Library/Application\ Support/schaltwerk/logs/schaltwerk-*.log

# Monitor performance issues
grep -E "slow|WARN|ERROR" ~/Library/Application\ Support/schaltwerk/logs/schaltwerk-*.log
```

### Debugging Tips
1. **Start with INFO level**: Default configuration shows important events
2. **Enable DEBUG for issues**: `RUST_LOG=ui=debug` for detailed flow
3. **Check timing**: Look for "slow" operations indicating performance issues
4. **Follow IDs**: Track specific terminal IDs through their lifecycle
5. **Check cleanup**: Ensure terminals in logs are properly closed


## MCP Server Integration

### Architecture Principles
- **MCP server must use REST API calls only**: Never directly access the SQLite database
- **Stateless design**: MCP server should be a stateless HTTP client to the Rust backend
- **Database operations**: All session/draft operations must go through `src-tauri/src/mcp_api.rs` endpoints

### MCP Development Workflow
```bash
# After making changes to MCP server TypeScript code:
cd mcp-server
npm run build          # Rebuild MCP server
# Then restart your MCP client/application to pick up changes
```

### Key API Endpoints
- `POST /api/drafts` - Create draft session
- `PATCH /api/drafts/{name}` - Update draft content (supports append=true)
- `POST /api/drafts/{name}/start` - Start draft as active session
- `DELETE /api/drafts/{name}` - Delete draft session

### Performance Patterns
- **Use atomic operations**: For draft content updates, use `append_draft_content()` instead of get-then-update pattern
- **Avoid double database calls**: All operations should be single transactions where possible

### Webhook Integration
MCP server notifies Rust backend via webhooks:
- `POST /webhook/draft-created` - When draft is created
- `POST /webhook/session-added` - When session becomes active
- `POST /webhook/session-removed` - When session is deleted

## Keyboard Shortcuts Documentation

When adding new keyboard shortcuts to the application, ensure they are also documented in the SettingsModal (`src/components/modals/SettingsModal.tsx`) to keep the keyboard shortcuts reference up-to-date.

### Testing MCP Changes
```bash
# Test MCP draft creation
echo '{"name": "test-draft", "content": "# Test Draft"}' | json_pp
# Verify draft appears in UI drafts section, not running sessions

# Test API endpoints directly
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8547/api/drafts -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"test","content":"test"}'
```

### Code Quality

- Do not write comments, ensure we have self-documenting code.
- Avoid writing fallbacks or alternative solutions to solve them. Rather fix them directly.
- Never write altnerative file names, functions or components. Rather fix them directly.
- Ask the user if problems seem impossible or difficult to solve for advice.
- Always develop deterministic solutions and never heuristics.
- Never use #[allow(dead_code)] Implement real implementations and unused code you can delete if we do not need it anymore.
- Never introduce YAGNI: Code that eventually will be needed in the future but not now, all the code must be used and referenced now
