## Core Capabilities

### 1. Plan and Create Specs

Draft multiple specs for complex features:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open orchestrator">
    Press `⌘1` to switch to orchestrator
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create specs">
    Use `⌘⇧N` to create planning documents:
    - Feature requirements

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manual Launch">
    1. Select first spec
    2. Press `⌘N` to start session
    3. Select next spec
    4. Press `⌘N` to start another session
    5. Switch between sessions with `⌘1-9`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="MCP Automation">
    ```javascript
    // Via MCP REST API or Claude
    const specs = [
      { name: 'auth-login', prompt: 'Implement login...' },
      { name: 'auth-register', prompt: 'Implement registration...' },
      { name: 'auth-reset', prompt: 'Implement password reset...' }
    ];

    for (const spec of specs) {
      await createSession(spec.name, spec.prompt);
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Review Agent Work

    - Changes are correct
  </Step>

  <Step title="Merge to main">
    From session header actions:
    - Create GitHub PR
    - Merge directly
    - Cherry-pick specific commits
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clean up">
    After successful merge, press `⌘D` to cancel session
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 5. Coordinate Workflows

Chain tasks together for complex automation:

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Example: Feature Breakdown
Orchestrator receives: "Build complete authentication system"

1. Break into specs:
   - Spec 1: User registration with email validation
   - Spec 2: Login with JWT tokens
   - Spec 3: Password reset via email
   - Spec 4: Session management

2. Launch agents on each spec in parallel

3. Monitor progress:
   - Check which sessions are complete
   - Identify any blocked sessions
   - Provide additional context if needed

4. Review completed work:
   - Run integration tests
   - Check for conflicts between sessions
   - Verify all acceptance criteria met

5. Integrate in order:
   - Merge dependencies first (e.g., session management)
   - Then merge features (registration, login, reset)
   - Run full test suite after each merge
```

```javascript Example: Bug Triage
Orchestrator receives: "Fix all failing tests"

1. Identify failing tests:
   - Run test suite
   - Parse output for failures
   - Group by module/component

2. Create spec for each failure:
   - Spec includes test output
   - Relevant file paths
   - Error messages

3. Assign agents to fix in parallel

4. Collect results:
   - Monitor which fixes are reviewed
   - Run tests to verify fixes
   - Merge passing fixes

5. Iterate if needed:
   - Re-run tests
   - Create new specs for remaining failures
```

### Prompt Templates

Save and reuse complex orchestration patterns:

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Template: Feature Breakdown
# Feature: [FEATURE_NAME]

## Goal
[Describe the feature]

## Breakdown
Create the following sessions:
1. [Component 1] - [Description]
2. [Component 2] - [Description]
3. [Component 3] - [Description]

## Dependencies
- [Component 1] must complete before [Component 2]
- All components use [shared dependency]

## Testing Strategy
- Integration tests after each component
- Full E2E tests after all merges
```

```markdown Template: Bug Triage
# Bug Triage: [ISSUE_ID]

## Problem
[Describe the bug]

## Investigation
1. Reproduce the issue
2. Identify root cause
3. Assess impact

## Fix Strategy
- Create specs for:
  1. [Fix 1]
  2. [Fix 2]
- Run tests after each fix
- Verify no regressions
```
</CodeGroup>

## Terminal Layout

The orchestrator has the same dual-terminal layout as regular sessions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Top Terminal">
    <Card icon="robot" color="#ec4899">
      **Agent Terminal**

      Run AI assistants that can:
      - Create and manage specs
      - Launch sessions programmatically
      - Monitor session progress
      - Coordinate multi-agent workflows
    </Card>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Bottom Terminal">
    <Card icon="terminal" color="#22c55e">
      **Your Shell**

      Use for:
      - Git operations
      - Running tests
      - Checking build status
      - Manual commands
    </Card>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Plan Before Launching">
    - Draft all specs first
    - Identify dependencies
    - Determine execution order
    - Consider resource constraints (don't run 20 agents at once)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Name Sessions Clearly">
    Use descriptive names that indicate:
    - What the session does
    - Which component it affects
    - Relationship to other sessions

    Examples:
    - `auth-login-implementation`
    - `api-user-endpoints`
    - `fix-email-validation-bug`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Resource Usage">
    Each session creates 3 OS processes:
    - Shell process
    - Agent process
    - Terminal backend

    Don't run too many sessions simultaneously
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Frequently">
    Don't let reviewed sessions pile up:
    - Review daily if possible
    - Merge or provide feedback
    - Keep the pipeline moving
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Workflows">
    Create prompt templates for:
    - Common feature patterns
    - Bug fix procedures
    - Review checklists
    - Integration strategies
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations

<Warning>
  **Be aware of these orchestrator limitations:**
</Warning>

- **No Worktree** - Orchestrator runs on main branch, not in isolation
- **Resource Usage** - Each session consumes system resources (3 processes)
- **Concurrent Agents** - Don't run too many agents simultaneously
- **Manual Merge** - Merging sessions still requires manual review and approval
